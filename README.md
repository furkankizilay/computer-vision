# Computer Vision With OpenCV

Computer vision with OpenCV involves the utilization of the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to empower machines with visual perception capabilities akin to human vision. OpenCV provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions that enable tasks such as image and video processing, object detection and tracking, facial recognition, and more. Its wide array of pre-built algorithms and techniques, ranging from basic image filtering to advanced machine learning-based methods, makes it a cornerstone for various applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and surveillance systems. By bridging the gap between the digital realm and the visual world, OpenCV plays a pivotal role in advancing technologies that rely on harnessing the power of computer vision.
